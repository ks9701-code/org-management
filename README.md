Organization Management Service

A multi-tenant backend service built with FastAPI and MongoDB, designed to support dynamic organization management where each organization gets its own MongoDB collection.
This project demonstrates a scalable and secure approach to multi-tenancy with clean architecture and RESTful APIs.

🌐 Live API

🔗 Swagger UI (Live API Docs):
https://org-management.onrender.com/docs

✅ The API is fully deployed and ready to use.
You can test all endpoints directly from Swagger UI.

⚠️ Note on Hosting (Render Free Tier):
This service is hosted on Render’s free plan, which spins down after inactivity.
The first request may take ~30–60 seconds to start the server (cold start).
Subsequent requests will be fast once the service is active.


## Architecture Overview

### Client Layer
- Postman or any Frontend application
- Communicates with the backend via HTTP / REST APIs

---

### Backend Layer (FastAPI Application)

#### API Routes
- `POST /org/create` – Create a new organization
- `GET /org/get` – Fetch organization details
- `PUT /org/update` – Update organization information
- `DELETE /org/delete` – Delete an organization
- `POST /admin/login` – Admin authentication and token generation

---

#### Services Layer
- **OrganizationService**
  - Handles organization creation, update, retrieval, and deletion
  - Manages dynamic MongoDB collection creation and migration
- **AuthService**
  - Handles admin authentication
  - Generates and validates JWT tokens

---

#### Core Utilities
- **JWT Authentication**
  - Secure, token-based access control
- **Bcrypt Security**
  - Password hashing and verification
- **Database Connection**
  - Centralized MongoDB connection handling

---

### Database Layer (MongoDB Atlas – Master Database)

#### Collections
- `organizations`
  - Stores organization metadata
- `admin_users`
  - Stores admin credentials and organization mapping
- `org_<organization_name>`
  - Dynamically created collection
  - One collection per organization

2️⃣ Admin Login (Get JWT Token)

Endpoint: POST /admin/login
Authentication: ❌ Not required

📎 Live Docs:
https://org-management.onrender.com/docs#/admin/admin_login_admin_login_post

Request

{
  "email": "admin@acme.com",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}


Response

{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "admin_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "organization_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
  "organization_name": "Acme Corp"
}


⚠️ Save the access_token — required for update & delete operations.

3️⃣ Update Organization

Endpoint: PUT /org/update
Authentication: ✅ Required (Bearer Token)

📎 Live Docs:
https://org-management.onrender.com/docs#/organizations/update_organization_org_update_put

Headers

Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>


Request

{
  "organization_name": "Acme Corp",
  "email": "newadmin@acme.com",
  "password": "newpassword123",
  "new_organization_name": "Updated Corp Name"
}


📌 Important Notes

organization_name must match your current org

email must be new

password updates admin password

new_organization_name is optional

Response

{
  "organization_name": "Updated Corp Name",
  "collection_name": "org_updated_corp_name",
  "admin_email": "newadmin@acme.com",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
  "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:01"
}

4️⃣ Delete Organization

Endpoint: DELETE /org/delete
Authentication: ✅ Required

📎 Live Docs:
https://org-management.onrender.com/docs#/organizations/delete_organization_org_delete_delete

Request

DELETE /org/delete?organization_name=Acme Corp
Authorization: Bearer <your-access-token>


Response

{
  "message": "Organization 'Acme Corp' deleted successfully"
}


📌 You can only delete your own organization.

5️⃣ Get Organization (Optional)

Endpoint: GET /org/get
Authentication: ❌ Not required

Request

GET /org/get?organization_name=Acme Corp

🚀 Key Features

✅ Multi-tenant Architecture (one MongoDB collection per org)

🔐 JWT-based Authentication

🔑 Bcrypt Password Hashing

⚙️ Dynamic Collection Creation

🔄 Automatic Data Migration on Rename

🧱 Clean Service-based Architecture

📄 Swagger & ReDoc API Docs

🎯 Design Decisions & Trade-offs
Dynamic Collections (Current Approach)

Pros

Strong data isolation

Easy organization deletion

Better query performance

Flexible schemas

Compliance-friendly

Cons

MongoDB collection limits

Index management overhead

Hard cross-organization queries

Backup complexity

Alternative Approaches

Shared collections with organization_id

Database-per-organization

Sharding by organization

📌 Chosen for this assignment:
Dynamic collections → simple, clear, and effective for small-to-medium scale.

🔒 Security Considerations

✅ Bcrypt password hashing

✅ JWT authentication with expiry

✅ Protected update & delete routes

✅ Pydantic input validation

Production Enhancements Recommended

HTTPS only

Rate limiting

Refresh tokens

Request logging

IP whitelisting

MongoDB role-based access
